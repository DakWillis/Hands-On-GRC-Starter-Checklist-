# Sample Reflection — Small Nonprofit (Cloud-first)

## What was hardest?
- Choosing a risk level without overengineering scoring.
- Keeping the control mapping to 1–2 controls per risk (easy to over-map).
- Writing evidence expectations that are realistic but portfolio-safe.

## What assumptions did you make?
- MFA exists but is not consistently enforced across all accounts.
- Shared Drives are used heavily without formal ownership standards.
- Event-based work increases laptop loss/theft exposure.

## What would you ask a system owner?
- Who should own each Shared Drive and approve access changes?
- Which folders truly require external sharing?
- What is the acceptable downtime for email/storage during an incident?

## What would an auditor challenge?
- “Show evidence of quarterly access reviews.”
- “Prove encryption is enabled on portable devices.”
- “Demonstrate how you detect and respond to public sharing links.”
