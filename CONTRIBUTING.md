# Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they keep the checklist lightweight and execution-focused.

## What we accept
- Improved templates (clearer fields, better instructions)
- Additional sample environments (nonprofit, SaaS, school IT, etc.)
- Framework mapping improvements (ISO / NIST)
- Clarity improvements in docs

## What we do NOT accept
- Overly complex risk scoring models
- Templates requiring paid tools to execute
- Long theory sections without execution value

## How to contribute
1) Fork the repo
2) Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>`
3) Submit a PR with:
   - what changed
   - why it improves execution
   - example usage if relevant
