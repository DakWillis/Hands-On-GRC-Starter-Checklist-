# Hands-On GRC Starter Checklist (v1)

A practical, lightweight checklist to build **real, defensible GRC experience** without overcomplicating it.

This repo is designed to help you produce portfolio-ready artifacts:
- Environment profile
- Asset inventory
- Risk register
- Risk → control mapping (ISO 27001 or NIST)
- Evidence plan
- Risk decisions
- Reflection notes (interview gold)

✅ **Goal:** Execute GRC, not just study it.

---

## Who this is for
- People pivoting into **Cyber GRC / Compliance / Risk**
- IT professionals who want to translate daily work into GRC artifacts
- Students who want a repeatable mini-project they can publish

---

## What you’ll produce (deliverables)
1) **Environment Profile** (fictional or familiar org)
2) **Asset Inventory** (10–15 assets)
3) **Risk Register** (5–8 risks)
4) **Risk → Control Mapping** (1–2 controls per risk)
5) **Evidence Plan** (what an auditor would ask for)
6) **Risk Decisions** (accept/mitigate/transfer/avoid)
7) **Reflection** (assumptions, challenges, audit questions)

---

## Time estimate (realistic)
- Step 1: 30–45 min
- Step 2: 45 min
- Step 3: 45–60 min
- Step 4: 45 min
- Step 5: 30 min
- Step 6: 20 min
- Step 7 (optional): 10–15 min

⏱ Total: **~3.5–4.5 hours**  
(You can also split it across 2 days.)

---

## Quick Start
1) Read `docs/quickstart.md`
2) Copy all files in `/templates` into a new folder named:
   `my-submission/` (or your org name)
3) Fill them out using your chosen environment
4) (Optional) Publish your filled artifacts in a separate repo for your portfolio

---

## Choose your framework
Pick **one**:
- **ISO/IEC 27001** (great for policy + ISMS thinking)
- **NIST CSF or NIST 800-53** (great for US-oriented environments)

Your mapping only needs to be **logical**, not perfect.

---

## Folder guide
- `/templates` → blank templates to fill
- `/examples` → fully filled sample outputs
- `/docs` → quickstart + FAQ

## Next versions (planned)
- v2: SSP mini-section
