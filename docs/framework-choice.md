# Choosing a Framework (ISO vs NIST)

## ISO/IEC 27001 (best for)
- compliance program thinking
- audits and evidence packs
- policies and control mapping

## NIST CSF / NIST 800-53 (best for)
- US-focused orgs and government-adjacent work
- technical control specificity
- structured control catalogs

## For v1
Pick ONE framework and keep mapping simple:
- 1–2 controls per risk
- focus on logic + evidence
