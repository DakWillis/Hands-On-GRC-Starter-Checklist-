# Quickstart (v1)

## Step 0 — Pick your environment
Use a fictional or familiar org (keep it safe and publishable):
- Small nonprofit (20–50 users)
- SaaS startup
- College IT department
- Healthcare clinic (non-clinical systems)

## Step 1 — Copy templates
Copy everything in `/templates` into a folder:
`my-submission/`

## Step 2 — Fill in order
1) Environment profile
2) Asset inventory
3) Risk register
4) Risk → control mapping
5) Evidence plan
6) Risk decisions
7) Reflection (optional)

## Step 3 — Review for clarity
If a stranger can’t understand your environment or risks, simplify language.

## Step 4 — Publish (optional)
Publish your completed work in a separate repo:
`hands-on-grc-case-<environment-name>`

This keeps your template repo clean and reusable.
