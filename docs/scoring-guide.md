# Risk Scoring Guide (Simple)

## Likelihood (1–5)
1 Rare  
2 Unlikely  
3 Possible  
4 Likely  
5 Almost certain

## Impact (1–5)
1 Negligible  
2 Low  
3 Medium  
4 High  
5 Severe

## Overall risk
- Low: (1–2 likelihood) and (1–2 impact)
- High: likelihood >=4 OR impact >=4
- Medium: everything else

The goal is consistency, not perfection.
