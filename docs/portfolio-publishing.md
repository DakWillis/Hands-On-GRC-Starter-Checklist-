# Publishing Your Work Safely (Portfolio Rules)

## Do not publish
- real names or emails
- internal URLs / shared drive paths
- asset tags, serial numbers, IPs, hostnames
- screenshots of admin consoles without heavy redaction

## Do publish
- synthetic sample data
- templates and checklists
- anonymized case summaries
- evidence expectations (what would exist)

## Recommended approach
1) Keep this repo as the template base
2) Publish your filled work in a separate repo:
   `hands-on-grc-case-nonprofit-cloud`
