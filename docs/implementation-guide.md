# Implementation Guide (Portfolio + Real-World Use)

This guide explains how to execute this checklist in a way that is:
- defensible (audit logic)
- lightweight (doesn’t become busywork)
- portfolio-safe (no sensitive info)

---

## Recommended workflow
### Day 1 (2 hours)
- Environment profile
- Asset inventory
- Draft risk register (5–8 risks)

### Day 2 (1.5–2.5 hours)
- Risk → control mapping
- Evidence plan
- Risk decisions
- Reflection bullets

---

## Make it portfolio-grade
A hiring manager should be able to open your submission and quickly understand:
1) what environment you’re modeling
2) what assets exist
3) what risks matter most
4) what controls reduce the risks
5) what evidence proves the controls
6) what decisions you made

---

## What NOT to do
- Don’t write a 10-page policy set for v1
- Don’t map every risk to 10 controls
- Don’t use real org names, emails, or screenshots of internal systems

---

## How to extend to v2/v3 later
- Add SSP mini-section (system security plan overview)
- Add vendor risk questionnaire
- Add audit walkthrough simulation
