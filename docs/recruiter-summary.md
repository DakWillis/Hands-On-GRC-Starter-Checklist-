# Recruiter Summary (Use in your README or LinkedIn)

This project demonstrates practical Cyber GRC execution by producing:
- an environment profile
- asset inventory
- risk register
- ISO 27001 control mapping
- evidence plan (audit-ready thinking)
- risk decisions (business judgment)

It is designed to show proof-of-work and repeatable governance workflows
rather than theoretical study notes.
